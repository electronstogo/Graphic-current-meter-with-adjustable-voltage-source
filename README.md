# Graphic-current-meter-with-adjustable-voltage-source



I build this device that can apply voltages from 0.5 V to 30 V to supply different electronic devices while graphically displaying their power consumption.

Components:
- RP2040
- 3.5 inch display
- Old 5V power supply unit 
- ZK-4KX voltage converter
- Mini voltage converter (to supply 8 V for ZK-4KX)
- INA219 current sensor
- Housing from 3D printer
- Switches, connectors, wires, etc.
